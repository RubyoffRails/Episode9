Episode 9 - Gems
=====================

Simple use of a gem created elsewhere.

How to Play
-----------

1. Clone this repo; checkout this branch: `hw_ep9`
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `cp -v config/database.yml{.sample,}`
4. Edit the `config/database.yml` as needed
5. Run `ruby adventure.rb`

That should play the game for you, using the adventure gem rather than a
local version of adventure.
